# BrainTumorDetectionWithAugmentation
Extension of GitHub user MohamedAliHabib's repository using other methods of data augmentation to attempt to improve classification model

Runnable scripts/commands: Clone the file titled "Tumor_Detection.ipynb". Import all the proper modules and download the GitHub repo in the first two cells. Next select which augmentation you are wishing to execute, and choose the cell containing the initialization of that augmentation. There are corresponding cells below to perform the augmentation, which will also create the proper directory for the augmented images to be stored in. Continue on by running each of the following cells, making sure to run only the first 24 epochs. Then, from the directory containing the model checkpoints, select the one with the highest accuracy to continue testing. F1 and accuracy results will be output accordingly, as well as a graph of the loss and accuracy across each epoch :)
